# PythonSearch | Version 0.2

***

## Whats new?

- Addons have arrived!
Addons are now avaliable in-app. Just visit settings and download them. At the moment only two addons are avaliable. (Those being GUI and Googlely (Suggests sites in the categories as you type)) Please provide feedback on these new addons so I can continue to make them better and more accessible and user-friendly.

- PythonSearch... but in colour (**ITS COLOUR**(In Aus))
PythonSearch is slowly becoming colour. You'll start seeing colour around the place in V0.2 soon. Currently in the main app and slowly moving to addons.

- Faster and also more lightweight
This kind of speaks for itself. I've made the code less laggy and overall faster.
